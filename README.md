## Business Task
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat. Bellabeat’s co-founders believe that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to understand how consumers use their smart devices. The insights discovered will then help guide the marketing strategy for the company.
